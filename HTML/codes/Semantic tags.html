        <article> My Story : I never really thought about being a software engineer since childhood. I have elder cousins who were in this field and hence I was introduced to the world of coding . I f I am being honest I don't really have much interest in technical stuff but think software engineers are really cool. The fact that I can create my own things and make a computer do stuff on my will is very intresting to me. Coding does not interest me that much but I am not completely disliking it either. I am looking forward to a future where I am a software engineer.<a href=""></a></article>
